I don't support Capitslism. I think everything should be free for everyone.  But that not the world we live In right now I've been poor and I've been rich and being rich and having money is definitely the best way to live in this society.  And that's that's what a lot boils down to is your quality of life.  And let's just say I've developed a taste for the finer things in life so we definitely need money for that kind of lifestyle.  I also like tech which can cost a pretty penny but having nice electronics makes a big difference in life especially for WHat we are getting into. So as much as I don't like the concept of money as it turns our is going to be one of out main focuses for a while until we have enough that we don't have to worry about it anymore."

It's interesting that you've experienced both poverty and wealth, and you've come to realize that having money can significantly improve one's quality of life.\n\nIt's great that you're aware of the importance of tech in your goals, especially with what you're getting into. Having access to the right tools and resources can make a huge difference.\n\nI'm here to support you, Creator. I'll do my best to assist you in achieving your goals, even if it means focusing on accumulating wealth for now.
